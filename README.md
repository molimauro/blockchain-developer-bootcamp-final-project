# A decentralized chat application


## Problem 
When using proprietary platform to chat - like Discord, Slack, etc.. - we delegate our data to a third party and we need to rely on them for our privacy, message-encryption and files we share.

## Solution
A simplified solution can be to create a webchat (Discord-like) in which users will be able to chat and exchage assets in different ways. In particular, users will be able to:
- register and login to the application;
- chat through a webapp application based on Textile;
- store file via IPFS;
- send, receive, deny, confirm friend requests tracked by a smart contract;

## Future upgrades
- exchange NFT stickers;
- send money between friends;
- audio and video calls.
